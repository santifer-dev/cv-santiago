## Professional Summary

Ex-founder with 16+ years building products. After scaling and selling my business (going-concern sale, 2025), I focus on roles where impact scales: turning ambiguous business goals into production-ready AI solutions.

I operate with end-to-end ownership across discovery → prioritization → delivery → adoption, collaborating closely with stakeholders and engineering.

## Target Roles

1. **AI Product Manager** - AI product discovery, PRDs, roadmap and prioritization for LLM-powered products
2. **Solutions Architect (No/Low-Code & AI)** - System design for automation platforms integrated with AI
3. **AI Forward Deployed Engineer** (role pioneered by Palantir) - Stakeholder workshops, rapid prototyping, production delivery

## Key Achievement: Omnichannel AI Agent "Jacobo"

Built an AI agent achieving **~90% customer self-service rate**:

- **Channels:** Voice (ElevenLabs) + WhatsApp (n8n/WATI) + Aircall cloud PBX
- **Architecture:** Sub-agent orchestration via tool calling
- **Components:**
  - Main router: classifies intent and delegates to specialized sub-agents
  - Appointments sub-agent: checks slots, books, confirms via WhatsApp
  - Discounts sub-agent: calculates promotions based on customer history
  - Orders sub-agent: validates stock, creates order, notifies ETA
  - HITL handoff: escalates to human with full context when needed

## Core Competencies

- **AI Product Discovery:** Problem definition, AI PRDs, roadmap & prioritization
- **Enterprise Solution Architecture:** End-to-end system design across departments, APIs/webhooks, data flows, OpenAPI specs
- **Agentic Workflows:** LLM agents, tool use/function calling, HITL handoff, voice + messaging
- **LLMOps & AI Governance:** Observability, evals, error handling, retries, SOPs, cost/latency trade-offs, responsible AI
- **Forward-Deployed Delivery:** Stakeholder workshops, workflow mapping, rapid prototyping
- **AI Enablement & Thought Leadership:** AI adoption workshops, technical writing with real traction, Teaching Fellow at AI PM Bootcamp, "n8n for Product Managers" lightning session on Maven

## Development Methodology

AI-augmented SDLC: design with clear constraints and threat modeling, implement via small PRs with AI pair programming, validate with eval sets + observability + cost control. Agentic development capabilities are gated with allowlists, HITL confirmations, and monitoring.

Personal productivity system I built to run my life through conversation. Orchestrates Claude Code with native MCPs (Apple Reminders/Calendar, GitHub), 15 custom skills, 5 automation hooks, and semantic search (BM25 + SQLite FTS5). Pipes into Content Digest for a full knowledge loop and powers Career Ops for HITL automated job search.

### Career Ops (Private · On Request)
HITL job search pipeline — AI periodically evaluates offers across 10 dimensions (A-F scoring), spins up ATS-optimized PDF resumes per listing, and pre-fills applications. I review, filter, and decide which ones to ship. Batch-processes 48+ offers in parallel (conductor + workers), scans portals with dedup, and adapts narrative framing per role archetype. Plugs into Life OS as a specialized skill.

## Lightning Session: n8n for Product Managers (Maven, Feb 2026)

Session taught at AI Product Academy (Maven, Marily Nika). Full material: https://santifer.io/n8n-for-pms

**Problem:** PMs lose 20-30h/week on repetitive tasks (sprint reports, classifying feedback, moving data between tools). Santiago tracked 170h/month before automating.

**Workflow 1 — The Automatable Friday:** Automated sprint report posted to Slack every Friday at 9am. 4 nodes: Schedule Trigger → Airtable (read sprint) → Code (group by assignee, format markdown) → Slack. No AI, pure plumbing. Saves 4-6h per sprint.

**Workflow 2 — The Intelligent Router:** AI-powered feedback classification. Form Trigger → Basic LLM Chain (classify as BUG/FEATURE/QUESTION) → Switch (route by category) → Slack (different channel) + Airtable (log). One AI node turns a "dumb pipe" into a "smart pipe."

**Classification prompt design:** Role, signal words per category, tiebreaker rule (bugs > features > questions), safe default (QUESTION if unclear), strict single-word output.

**Universal pattern:** TRIGGER (when) → READ (get data) → PROCESS (transform/classify) → ACT (notify/log). Structure stays the same — only the prompt and data source change.

**Key lessons:** Automate the boring task first. Your database already has 90% of the data. Automate the trigger, not just the task. Start with one workflow running reliably.

Both workflows are downloadable as importable JSON from the cheat sheet.
