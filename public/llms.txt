## Professional Summary

Ex-founder with 16+ years building products. After scaling and selling my business (going-concern sale, 2025), I focus on roles where impact scales: turning ambiguous business goals into production-ready AI solutions.

I operate with end-to-end ownership across discovery → prioritization → delivery → adoption, collaborating closely with stakeholders and engineering.

## Target Roles

1. **AI Product Manager** - AI product discovery, PRDs, roadmap and prioritization for LLM-powered products
2. **Solutions Architect (No/Low-Code & AI)** - System design for automation platforms integrated with AI
3. **AI Forward Deployed Engineer** - Stakeholder workshops, rapid prototyping, production delivery

## Key Achievement: Omnichannel AI Agent "Jacobo"

Built an AI agent achieving **~90% customer self-service rate**:

- **Channels:** Voice (ElevenLabs) + WhatsApp (n8n/WATI) + Aircall cloud PBX
- **Architecture:** Sub-agent orchestration via tool calling
- **Components:**
  - Main router: classifies intent and delegates to specialized sub-agents
  - Appointments sub-agent: checks slots, books, confirms via WhatsApp
  - Discounts sub-agent: calculates promotions based on customer history
  - Orders sub-agent: validates stock, creates order, notifies ETA
  - HITL handoff: escalates to human with full context when needed

## Core Competencies

- **AI Product Discovery:** Problem definition, AI PRDs, roadmap & prioritization
- **Solution Architecture:** Requirements, system design, APIs/webhooks, OpenAPI specs
- **Agentic Workflows:** LLM agents, tool use/function calling, HITL handoff, voice + messaging
- **LLMOps Foundations:** Eval loops, monitoring/telemetry, cost/latency trade-offs
- **Forward-Deployed Delivery:** Stakeholder workshops, workflow mapping, rapid prototyping
- **Reliability & Ops:** Monitoring, event logs, error handling, retries, SOPs

## Development Methodology

AI-augmented SDLC: design with clear constraints and threat modeling, implement via small PRs with AI pair programming, validate with eval sets + observability + cost control. Agentic development capabilities are gated with allowlists, HITL confirmations, and monitoring.
